They are saying that a man will have to die to protect his life. 
if you agree to fight you agree to die. 
Now if you die to protect your life you aren't alive anyhow so how is there any sense in a thing like that? 
A man doesn't say I will starve myself to death to keep from starving. 
He doesn't say I will spend all my money in order to save my money. 
He doesn't say I will burn my house down in order to keep it from burning. 
Why then should he be willing to die for the privilege of living? 
There ought to be at least as much common sense about living and dying as there is about going to the grocery store and buying a loaf of bread.
