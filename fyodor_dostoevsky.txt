Christ knew that by bread alone you cannot reanimate man. 
If there were no spiritual life, no ideal of Beauty, man would pine away, die, go mad, kill himself or give himself to pagan fantasies. 
And as Christ, the ideal of Beauty in Himself and his Word, he decided it was better to implant the ideal of Beauty in the soul. 
If it exists in the soul, each would be the brother of everyone else and then, of course, working for each other, all would also be rich. 
Whereas if you give them bread, they might become enemies to each other out of boredom.
