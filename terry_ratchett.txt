The dwarf bread was brought out for inspection. 
But it was miraculous, the dwarf bread. 
No one ever went hungry when they had some dwarf bread to avoid. 
You only had to look at it for a moment, and instantly you could think of dozens of things you'd rather eat. 
Your boots, for example. Mountains. Raw sheep. Your own foot.
